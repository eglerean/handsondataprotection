00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
At the time that you started working in computer music,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,800
most computer usage was for purposes like accounting and ballistics calculations.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,800
What made you even think of using computers as a creative tool?

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:19,520
I had come to Stanford in 1962 from three years studying in Paris

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,020
with Nadia Boulanger, who was a well-known teacher,

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,820
and people such as Aaron Copland.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,220
And Quincy Jones and I were there at the same time studying.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,580
So she was an important figure in Paris, musical circles.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,920
But as important to my own education as Nadia Boulanger

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,980
was the musical scene in general in Paris.

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,960
Pierre Boulez was a young avant-garde enfant terrible,

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,320
often referred to in such a way, in Paris

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,460
and had a series of concerts, the Domaine Musical,

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,160
in which he played.
