I had come to Stanford in 1962 from three years studying in Paris
with Nadia Boulanger, who was a well-known teacher,
and people such as Aaron Copland.
And Quincy Jones and I were there at the same time studying.

was the musical scene in general in Paris.
Pierre Boulez was a young avant-garde enfant terrible,
often referred to in such a way, in Paris
and had a series of concerts, the Domaine Musical,
in which he played.
