At the time that you started working in computer music,

00:03.540 --> 00:08.800
most computer usage was for purposes like accounting and ballistics calculations.

00:09.620 --> 00:13.800
What made you even think of using computers as a creative tool?

00:14.060 --> 00:19.520
I had come to Stanford in 1962 from three years studying in Paris

00:19.520 --> 00:24.020
with Nadia Boulanger, who was a well-known teacher,

00:24.380 --> 00:26.820
and people such as Aaron Copland.

00:26.820 --> 00:31.220
And Quincy Jones and I were there at the same time studying.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.580
So she was an important figure in Paris, musical circles.

00:37.160 --> 00:41.920
But as important to my own education as Nadia Boulanger

00:41.920 --> 00:44.980
was the musical scene in general in Paris.

00:45.780 --> 00:49.960
Pierre Boulez was a young avant-garde enfant terrible,

00:50.240 --> 00:54.320
often referred to in such a way, in Paris

00:54.320 --> 00:58.460
and had a series of concerts, the Domaine Musical,

00:58.980 --> 01:00.160
in which he played.
